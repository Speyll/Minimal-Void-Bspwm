## introduction
this is my simple dotfiles for a simple setup of bspwm in Void Linux, the goal of this setup is to be as minimal as possible on resources without completely dropping the eye candy<br />

## preview images
![busy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Speyll/void-bspwm/master/screenshots/busy.png)<br />
this is tmux with vim, sxiv is the image viewer and nnn is the file manager/browser<br />
![surf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Speyll/void-bspwm/master/screenshots/customsurf.png)<br />
custom surf (added homepage patch) in tabbed and a poorlymade startpage both tabbed and surf can be downloaded here ![mysuckless](https://github.com/Speyll/mysuckless)<br />
![mpv and dmenubar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Speyll/void-bspwm/master/screenshots/dmenubar_and_vidya.png) <br />
I have a lemonbar setup (can be toggled with sxhkd) but I rarely use it, prefer the barless way instead i use dmenu as a bar, it's amazing how much you can do with it, for my video player it's a pretty basic mpv with some youtube-dl<br />
